Streams in Java:
    1. Byte stream : InputStream, OutputStream
        => all the stream related classes(classes ends with Stream) deals with byte data.
    2. Character stream : Reader, Writer
        => all the character related classes(classes ends with Reader or Writer) deals with character data.


1. Byte streams:
    a) InputStream : Read data
        1.FileInputStream :
            read raw bytes from a file (when we have binary data-audio, image, pdf, also reading text file as bytes)
            reads one byte at a time
        2.ByteArrayInputStream :
            read data from a byte array as if it were an input stream
            read bytes from byte array->fast
        3.BufferedInputStream :
            use buffering for fast reading
            adds buffering to another input stream to improve performance(when we have large files or have to reducing disk access)
            reads a block of bytes into memory, then serves bytes from buffer
        4.DataInputStream :
            reads primitive data types
            can read int, float, double, boolean
    b) OutputStream : Write data
        1.FileOutputStream :
            write raw bytes to a file
            writes binary files(image, audio, pdf etc. and also write text data as bytes)
        2.ByteArrayOutputStream :
            writes data into a byte array instead of file, which grows automatically
        3.BufferedOutputStream :
            use buffering for fast writing
            when we want to writing large data or reducing disk I/O operations
        4.DataOutputStream
            writes primitive data types
            can write int, float, double, boolean

2.Character streams:
    a) Reader: reads characters
        1.FileReader :
            reads character from a file.
            reading text file
        2.BufferedReader :
            reads text efficiently using buffering
            adds buffering to another Reader for better performance
            can read entire line using readLine()
        3.InputStreamReader :
            bridge between byte streams and character streams
            convert bytes into characters

        3.StringReader : reads character from a string.
    b) Writer
        1.FileWriter : writes character to a file
        2.StringWriter : writes character into
        3.BufferedWriter : writes text efficiently using buffering
